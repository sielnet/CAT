/**
 * This file contains the TestModule class
 *
 * This is a very basic example of using the CAT API.  
 *
 * The module contains two files
 * in the Files directory. They will illustrate the use of the {@link DeviceConfig::copyFile()} method.
 * One file will be copied without the name change, for the second we will provide a new name.
 * The API also contains a similar {@link DeviceConfig::translateFile()} method, which is special to Windows installers and not used in this example.
 *
 * This module will collect all certificate files stored in the database for a given profile and will copy them to the working directory.
 *
 * If, for the given profile, an information file is available, this will also be copied to the working directory.
 *
 * The installer will collect all available configuration attributes and save them to a file in the form of the PHP print_r output.
 *
 * Finally, the installer will create a zip archive containing all above files and this file 
 * will be sent to the user as the configurator file.
 *
 * Go to the {@link DeviceTestModule} and {@link DeviceConfig} class definitions to learn more.

/**
 * This is the main implementation class of the module
 *
 * The name of the class must the the 'Device' followed by the name of the module file
 * (without the '.php' extension), so in this case the file is "TestModule.php" and
 * the class is DeviceTestModule.
 *
 * The class MUST define the constructor method and one additional 
 * public method: {@link writeInstaller()}.
 *
 * All other methods and properties should be private. This example sets zipInstaller method to protected, so that it can be seen in the documentation.
 *
 * It is important to understand how the device module fits into the whole picture, so here is s short description.
 * An external caller (for instance {@link GUI::generateInstaller()}) creates the module device instance and prepares
 * its environment for a given user profile by calling {@link DeviceConfig::setup()} method.
 *      this will:
 *       - create the temporary directory and save its path as $this->FPATH
 *       - process the CA certificates and store results in $this->attributes['internal:CAs'][0]
 *            $this->attributes['internal:CAs'][0] is an array of processed CA certificates
 *            a processed certifincate is an array 
 *               'pem' points to pem feromat certificate
 *               'der' points to der format certificate
 *               'md5' points to md5 fingerprint
 *               'sha1' points to sha1 fingerprint
 *               'name' points to the certificate subject
 *               'root' can be 1 for self-signed certificate or 0 otherwise
 *       - save the info_file (if exists) and put the name in $this->attributes['internal:info_file_name'][0]
 * Finally, the module {@link DeviceConfig::writeInstaller ()} is called and the returned path name is used for user download.
