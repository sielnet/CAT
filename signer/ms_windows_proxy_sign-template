# This script is a part of the eduroam CAT softwareand covered by the approapriate license

# plugged into remote machines. This script is set to use two servers but yoy can define more, if you like.

# PREFIX may come handy if your software is located in one place

# Set CERTS to issuer certificate chains saved as PEM files
